# Gloogloo â€“ Distributed Search Engine

Gloogloo is an advanced search engine designed to go beyond traditional keyword-based search by leveraging web scraping techniques to extract and index rich data from the internet. The system is engineered for high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring continuous operation even under failure conditions.

At its core, Gloogloo utilizes Java RMI to facilitate seamless communication between distributed servers, enabling scalable and resilient system architecture. The backend uses Spring Boot services, while the frontend employs Thymeleaf in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, offering a responsive and intuitive user interface.

Key features include dynamic update capabilities, comprehensive server monitoring through real-time statistics, and the ability to input specific URLs for targeted web scraping. This modular architecture allows for easy system expansion and maintenance, making Gloogloo a robust solution for web data retrieval and distributed search services.

This repository contains work originally done in collaboration with [Francisca Mateus](https://github.com/franciscamateusPt05) and [Ramyad Raadi](https://github.com/Ramyad20) in a private repository belonging to Francisca.

## Introduction

The goal of Gloogloo is to simulate the behavior of a distributed search engine by building a backend that handles indexing, search, and statistics and a frontend that serves as the user interface. Communication is achieved using Java RMI and REST APIs (HackerNews, OpenRoute).

---

## System Architecture

### Gateway

- Acts as the central controller and entry point.
- Manages Barrel registration, search routing, and queue operations.
- Maintains statistics (top searches, response times, barrel sizes).
- Offers administrative insights in real-time.

### Barrels

- Serve as independent SQLite-backed storage nodes.
- Store indexed content, title, snippet, and links.
- Handle search queries and word frequency statistics.
- Do not communicate directly â€” coordination via Gateway.

### Downloaders

- Retrieve URLs from Queue, download and parse web pages using **Jsoup**.
- Normalize and index content.
- Push indexed data to all Barrels via a reliable multicast approach.
- Sync stopwords dynamically and retry failed operations.

### Queue

- Manages a URL buffer and stopword list.
- Acts as the dispatch center for URLs.
- Ensures load balancing between Downloaders.
- Provides persistent in-memory TXT-based storage.

---

## Functionalities

- **Insert & Index URL**  
  Submit a URL via frontend â†’ sent to Gateway â†’ added to Queue â†’ indexed by Downloaders â†’ stored in all Barrels.

- **Keyword Search**  
  Search for one or more terms â†’ routed to Gateway â†’ queries a random Barrel â†’ returns relevant URLs/snippets.

- **Related URL Search**  
  Submit a URL â†’ system returns semantically related URLs using indexed link data.

- **Admin Interface**  
  Real-time stats including:
  - Top search terms
  - Average Barrel response times
  - Barrel index sizes

---

## Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies and tools are installed:

- Java JDK 22
- Maven
- SQLite
- Spring Boot
- Libraries:
  - Gson
  - Unirest
  - Jsoup
  - org.json

All `.properties` files must be correctly configured for host/IP and ports.

---

## Execution Instructions

### 1. Configure IPs and Ports

Set correct host and port values in:

- `gateway.properties`
- `queue.properties`
- `barrel.properties`

Ensure all components are referencing consistent IPs/ports to allow successful communication.

---

### 2. Build the Project

Open your terminal and run the following commands to build all components:

```bash
cd Gloogloo/common
mvn clean install -DskipTests

cd Gloogloo/backend
mvn clean install -DskipTests

cd Gloogloo/frontend
mvn clean install -DskipTests

cd Gloogloo
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
### 3. Executing the files 
Now the user should proceed to run the following files in seperate terminals
 ```bash
 QueueServer.java 
 Gateway.java 
 BarrelServer.java 
 Barrel2Server.java 
 Downloader.java
```
### 4. Running the frontend
For the final step the user has to run the following command in the given directory of "cd Gloogloo/frontend"
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -DskipTests
```
